Completed Practicals for Stats Learning

This was a lecture course taught by Dr.Tengyao Wang (http://www.homepages.ucl.ac.uk/~ucaktwa/) during my MMaths Degree in Cambridge.

Trivia -- As far as I'm aware, this course contained the one and only lecture in the Cambridge Maths Tripos on Neural Networks... in its entire history. Having taught the lone lecture on the topic, Tengyao departed to teach data UCL, and the tripos descended back into the dark ages.

Sadly, I did not include that historic notebook in here.
